Current SkewTune depends on following packages. All dependent packages are
bundled in the lib directory.

* Hadoop 0.21.0

http://hadoop.apache.org/

(Not tested with other versions. Integration with 0.20.203 was attempted but
did not work due to the race condition problem during the output commit).

* Apache Commons Math >= 2.2
